# Lab 10: Capture/Compare/PWM and ADC modules

Note: Desirable to have an oscilloscope nearby as some excercises need measuring.

What to expect on each source file:

Excercise1:
- Generating a square signal with a duty cycle of 50% by using the PWM module. It then shows the result by connecting the output to a LED.

Excercise2:
- Generating a square signal with a duty cycle of 75% and the maximun period allowed by using the PWM module.

Excercise3:
- Measuring a square signal and showing the result on Port D deppending on the next values: (1MHz -> 0x01) (100KHz -> 0x0A) (10KHz -> 0xCA) (4KHz -> 0xFA)

Excercise4:
- Analog to digital converter and showing the result connected to a CD motor.
